Introduction
Data Structure is the way of organizing the data to retrieve it with minimum cost and utilization of resources.

On the flip side, Machine Learning is a field of computer science that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to intimate the way of learning.

Machine Learning overall consists of approaches and techniques which are entirely built on statistics, probability and optimization.

The first two building blocks are related to mathematics and the third one is related to Data Structures and Algorithms. Ultimately Machine learning is a field modeled to play with data and generate something significant.



What is the use of Data Structures in Machine Learning?
1. The link Between Data Structures and Machine Learning
Basically, the essence of Data Structures is how we store data and retrieve the data. Programming language is a medium to represent those structures in a human-readable way.

Now assume that there is a problem that we want to solve using machine learning.

Then as a Machine Learning professional, you need to be aware of which model is fastest and eats up minute space while precisely solving the problem.

This model often consists of steps that are using multiple data structures to achieve the above-mentioned objectives.

So a professional having a good hold on Data Structures can answer the following question that he/she has to face in daily work.

How much time will the model(solution) take to complete the process?
How many space resources are utilized while doing the process?
Which model is better while considering the trade-off between time, space and business requirement
If a professional is working in production then a terrific grasp of data structure, algorithms and computer architecture is necessary to drive business solutions.

2. Real-time Predictions in Machine Learning
Assume we have a problem of object detection which we want to solve using machine learning. To solve this we have a model where we are getting 10 frames per second as input and our algorithms in the model will accumulate those frames to generate the desired output.

Our model has a requirement of a minimum of 10 frames per second which we can call real-time input. In the worst case, If the input rate goes beyond 10 frames then input can be classified as obsolete and model prediction can be seen as laggy and it wouldnâ€™t be able to give the desired output.

So if a practitioner has knowledge of Data Structure and Algorithms then he/she can easily modify algorithms with the use of proper data structures to improve performance up to the mark. Which will further result in object prediction in real-time.

3. Link Prediction Machine Learning Algorithm
We will take the example of social media, Suppose we want to update you with suggestions of who can be your next connection.

This problem can be easily modeled as a graph data structure where there are 2 entities and we want to figure out if there is any link between them.
